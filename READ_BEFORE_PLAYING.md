HELLO!

A few things i need to tell you about this game before you download it:

1- EPILEPSY WARNING (yes, i've put some flashing lights, so... if you have epilepsy, just don't play it, please)
2- SHUTDOWN COMMAND (if you die in the game, your PC will turn OFF, completely... no exeptions)
3- VOLUME UP (yes, it is a text-based game, BUT i installed a quite interesting library called "pygame", and with this library i can put audios in a .py file! YAY!)
4- JUMPSCARES? (yeah... it's not like Five Nights At Freddy's that an animatronic will jump in your face, but remember about the sounds? Yeah, they might caught you off guard...)
5- HAVE FUN! (yes, it is only text, yes, there is a few sounds and basic command lines, i know ok? But give it a try, 5 of my friends tested the game for me, all of them were scared)

So yeah... i think thats it, if you want to play the game in english, let me know! i can make other versions of N0N4M3.EXE for different languages!

THATS ALL!

GOOD LUCK!
